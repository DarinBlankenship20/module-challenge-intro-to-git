 ## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in the source code.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system and a tool to manage your source code. GitHub is a cloud based hosting service.
3. Why do we create a branch? To make changes to the main branch without changing the main branch intially.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? It is a way to notify your team you have work that needs to be reviewed, it is also a summary of your changes.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? git checkout -b     For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch retrieves the lastest data from the original but does not file transfer while git pull will do that but also copy those changes from the remote repository. 
git merge will put all the forked history back together again.
7. What is a merge conflict? Is usually when one person that is working on the same line of code as another person deletes the same line of code that they just edited in a file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? go to the pull requests under the repository name. Find the pull request with the merge conflict then near the bottom of the request click Resolve conflicts
